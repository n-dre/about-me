     My name is Andre, and I go by Dre. I am a combat veteran of the U.S Army
     forces. I served for 14 years.
     I am exciting to learn new things, and I always try to do my best during 
     obstacles.

     My goal is to build a startup, which would help to explain why people
     don't need to go to the banks anymore, whereas they would be able to 
     do everything at home, in their portable mobile phones
